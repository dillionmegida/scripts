# Utility Scripts

This a compilation of CLI scripts I use for my development or other operations on my device.

The scripts I have so far:

* `deletexml`: which I use for deleting XML files that are generated when I take videos with my Sony Camera...for 20 videos, I have 20 XML files, so I easily delete them with this command
